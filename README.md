Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the final projects from my Master of Science in Applied Data Science program at University of Chicago. 
This collection highlights a range of data-driven work I've completed, demonstrating skills in data analysis, machine learning, visualization, and more.

### About the Projects
These projects were developed as part of my graduate coursework experiences. They cover topics such as predictive modeling, natural language processing, data mining, and time series analysis. Each project includes presentation, code, datasets (where applicable), and documentation to illustrate the problem-solving process.

Individual Projects: These were solo efforts where I handled everything from data collection to deployment.
Group Projects: Collaborative works with classmates, emphasizing teamwork, version control, and interdisciplinary approaches. Contributions from team members are noted in the respective project folders.

Feel free to explore the repositories linked below or cloned here for a deeper dive.
